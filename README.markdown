Welcome! ðŸ˜Š

This repository contains scripts that I use for carrying out various tasks in Windows, mostly (but not exclusively) administrative tasks.

## Preamble

### How to download

You can either download each script individually or clone this entire repository. With two exceptions, scripts are standalone and have no dependencies.

### How to run

Most scripts are in PowerShell, so you need to open a PowerShell window to run them.

**DO NOT** try to run scripts by the following methods:

1. Issuing a `PowerShell.exe ScriptName.ps1` command (although, `pwsh.exe ScriptName.ps1` works)
2. Right-clicking `ScriptName.ps1`, selecting Open With..., choosing Windows PowerShell

Reason: PowerShell's script execution syntax is:

```plain
powershell.exe -File "<ScriptName.ps1>" <parameters>
```
This inconvenience is not present in PowerShell 7.4.

### Getting update notifications

I often update the scripts. Hence, you may be interested in receiving update notifications.

However, I've decided against creating point releases because most people need one or two scripts,
not all. In addition, these scripts are ready to use in their source code states. That's the nature
of a script. So, creating a point release is an time-consuming for me and counterproductive for
users. As such, subscribing to release notifications on GitHub won't work.

To address that issue, starting today, I'll publish update logs on [my personal blog]. You can
subscribe to the blog via RSS or a WordPress.com account.

### Apps

The following scripts help you manage your software.

- **~~Get AppX package names.ps1~~:** Returns the friendly app names of all packaged apps (AppX or
  MSIX) installed for the current user.

  DEPRECATED. Please use WinGet instead.

  Starting with Windows 8, Microsoft created an app architecture that was optimized for distribution
  via Microsoft Store. After many name changes (Metro-style app, modern app, Store app, UWP app,
  WinRT app, etc.), Microsoft has finally settled for "Packaged app" because these apps have package
  identities. These apps must be distributed in AppX or MSIX packages.
  
  The `Get-AppxPackage` cmdlet returns a list of all packaged apps on the system along with their
  package IDs, e.g., `58027.265370AB8DB33_fjemmk5ta3a5g`. However, the cmdlet doesn't show their app
  names. This script mitigates that issue. It lists all packaged apps installed for the current user
  account, along with their app names.

- **Get installed apps.ps1:** Queries Windows Registry for a list of installed apps.

  This script queries Windows Registry for a list of apps that have registered uninstallers, and
  displays their target CPU architecture (Arch), friendly name, and their registered uninstaller. 
  In Windows PowerShell 5.1, you could accomplish the same via the `Get-Package` cmdlet because
  Windows comes bundled with a "Programs" package provider. This provider is not available in
  PowerShell 7.0 and later.

- **Is x64.ps1:** Determines whether an EXE file is marked as x64.

  Windows EXE files have a platform marker. This scripts determines whether that platform marker is
  x64 and returns a Boolean in answer to that question. Beware that EXE files NOT marked as x64 can
  still extract and run x64-only payloads.

- **~~Reinstall AppX Packages.ps1~~:** Re-registers all packaged apps by Microsoft Corporation for
  the current user.

  DEPRECATED. I strongly recommend not to use it.

  This script queries all mainline packaged apps whose publishers are "cw5n1h2txyewy" (Microsoft
  apps) or "8wekyb3d8bbwe" (Windows components). Re-registers them for the current user.

- **~~Remove AppX packages.ps1~~:** Uninstalls packaged apps bundled with Windows from the current
  user account.

  DEPRECATED. Please use WinGet instead.

  When Windows 10 was first published in 2015, it was bloated with marginally useful packaged apps.
  To their credit, they had no performance impact. Yet, their very existence was a violation of the
  principle of lean systems. This script uninstalls them all for the current user.

- **~~Repair system AppX packages.ps1~~:** Re-registers all AppX packages in the "SystemApp" folder.

  DEPRECATED. I strongly recommend not to use it.

  This script looks for  packages installed in "SystemApp" and re-registers them for the current
  user account.

### BITS

The following scripts ask the BITS service for a list of all of its download and upload operations with a certain status and format the results in a certain form. More specifically:

Script name                             | Desired job status         | Format
--------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------
**Get active BITS jobs, detailed.ps1**  | "Transferring"             | List
**Get active BITS jobs, table.ps1**     | "Transferring"             | Table
**Get pending BITS jobs, detailed.ps1** | anything but "Transferred" | List
**Get pending BITS jobs, table.ps1**    | anything but "Transferred" | Table

**Get all BITS jobs, custom.ps1** asks the BITS service for list of all of its operation, then summarizes them, so that only the job status, job ID, display name, type, priority, bytes transferred, and bytes total are shown, along with a list of all files in each job.

### Code snippets

This folder contains code that one should not run directly. Rather, PowerShell developers could read them, learn from them, or include portions of them in their PowerShell scripts.

- **Function library.psm1**: Contains a number of reusable functions. I've chosen the `.psm1` filename extension to prevent it from being accidentally run as a script, but it is not a real module. Each function has its own local help. The functions include:

    - **Test-ProcessAdminRight**: Returns $True when the process running this script has administrative privileges. Starting with PowerShell 4.0, the "Requires -RunAsAdministrator" directive prevents the execution of the script when administrative privileges are absent. However, there are still times that you'd like to just check the privilege (or lack thereof), e.g., to announce it to the user or downgrade script functionality gracefully.

    - **Test-UserAdminMembershipDirect**: Returns $True when the user account running this script is a **direct** member of the local Administrators group. However, even when this function returns $False, the user account may still be a nested member of said group. This function has several use cases, but it is not a reliable test as to whether the script running it has administrative privileges. (For that purpose, use Test-ProcessAdminRight.)

    - **Test-UserAdminMembershipRecursive**: Returns $True when the user account running this script is a member (direct or nested) of the local Administrators group. This function is not a reliable test as to whether the script running it has administrative privileges. (For that purpose, use Test-ProcessAdminRight.) However, it has several use cases, one of which is knowing whether the current user can request elevated access through the User Account Control.

    - **Unregister-ScheduledTaskEx**: Unregisters several scheduled tasks whose names matches a wildcard patten (not regex).

    - **Remove-RegistryValue**: Attempts to remove one or more values from a given path in Windows Registry.

    - **New-TemporaryFileName**: Generates a string to use as your temporary file's name.

    - **New-TemporaryFolderName**: Generates a string to use as your temporary folder's name.

    - **Get-AlphaUpper:** Returns an array of Char containing the English uppercase letters.

    - **Get-AlphaLower:** Returns an array of Char containing the English lowercase letters.

    - **Exit-BecauseOsIsNotSupported:** Ends the script with the following terminating error: "This operating system is not supported." Raises `PSInvalidOperationException`.

    - **Exit-BecauseFolderIsMissing:** Ends the script with the following terminating error: "Could not find the `$Title` at '`$Path`'." Raises `System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException`.

    - **Exit-BecauseFileIsMissing:** Ends the script with the following terminating error: "Could not find the `$Title` at '`$Path`'." Raises `System.IO.FileNotFoundException`.

- **PSM1 template.psm1**: A simple template for creating `.psm1` files. It enables the strict mode, separates the public functions from private functions, and exposes the public functions.

- **PS1 template:** A simple template for creating `.ps1` files. It has skeleton code for comment-based help, importing the `System.Management.Automation` namespace, a parameter block, and an entry point function called `PublicStaticVoidMain`. While writing code in Visual Studio Code, this entry point function helps you keep your variables and logic within a function scope and avoid poisoning your environment with residue variables in the global scope.

### Demos

- **ANSI escape sequences.ps1:** Demonstrates the use of ANSI escape sequences to write text in plain, bold, underlined, and inverse styles, as well as in the 16 basic colors.

- **Hello, World!.ps1:** All developers start their journey by writing a "Hello, World!" app. This is the app in PowerShell.

- **Message boxes in PowerShell.ps1:** This scripts demonstrates how to invoke message boxes within a PowerShell script. Normally, one must not use message boxes (or `Write-Host`) inside PowerShell scripts. Before Windows 10, however, console apps had serious problems displaying Unicode characters, so I used message boxes instead.

- **Pipeline-ready function.ps1:** Demonstrates how PowerShell passes objects through the pipeline.

- **Sort order.ps1:** Demonstrates how differently .NET sorts visually identical String[] and Char[] arrays.

- **System colors.ps1:** Demonstrates the `System.Drawing.SystemColors` class. This class enumerates the colors that Windows 7 uses to render its standard UI on the screen. Unfortunately, this class has limited uses in Windows 10 because it cannot retrieve the new Accent Color.

- **Working paths.ps1:** In PowerShell, "working path" is an elusive concept. Cmdlets obey the PowerShell run-space's current folder while .NET methods use the "current folder" set onto the hosting process, e.g., `PowerShell.exe` or `PwSh.exe`.

### Graphics

- **Find good JPEG images.ps1:** This script first enumerates JPEG files within a folder. You can specify the `-Recurse` switch to force searching subfolders too. After that, it opens each file and extracts it width and height in pixels. The script silently ignores JPEG files that it cannot parse. I use this script to find JPEG images that use Huffman Coding instead of Arithmetic Coding.

- **Find good JPEG images (Opt-1).ps1:** This script is my attempt to improve the performance of `Find good JPEG images.ps1`. I reasoned that instead of loading an entire JPEG file, I can load only the first 32 kB and still retrieve its width and height. I reasoned that reading less from the disk translates to higher performance. I was not wrong, but I had grossly overestimated the performance gain. I let both script loose over a set of 46,419 JPEG files. The performance gain was ... insignificant.

### Hardware

- **Get-CpuIntrinsicsSupport.ps1:** Has a specific app ever required a CPU feature? Have you ever been uncertain whether your CPU has that feature? If the answers to both questions are "Yes," this script is for you. Run it, and it will report all CPU features that .NET 8.0 recognizes.
- **Set-BluetoothRadio.ps1:** Turns the Bluetooth module on or off.

### Last logon time

- **Get last logon  time.ps1** returns a list of all local user accounts, as well as the date and time of their last logon.

- **Get last logon  time (Deprecated).vbs** takes a long time to run, but returns a list of all local user accounts, as well as the date and time of their last logon. A matter of licensing: I did not write this script. The user who posted it was called `Corvus1` and posted it in educational spirit. It's very old and outdated anyway; it's best not to use it.

### Maintenance

- **Clean compatibility store.ps1:** This script cleans the Windows compatibility store of items that you no longer have installed. This cleanup act is unlikely to improve your system's performance or stability. Perform it only if you absolutely need it, e.g., on a system you're preparing for generalization/imaging, to protect your privacy, or if a ludicrous lawsuit settlement is forcing you.

- **Compile PowerShell native images.bat:** Runs nGen inside Windows PowerShell. While PowerShell 6 and 7 run on .NET Core, Windows PowerShell and some Windows-exclusive PowerShell modules (which PowerShell 7 also loads) run on .NET Framework. Run this script with admin privileges whenever you update .NET Framework, or whenever you feel Windows PowerShell or PowerShell 7 for Windows are sluggish at launch time.

- **Find broken services.ps1:** Finds and list Windows services whose executable file paths are invalid. These services cannot start. This script won't delete them. In fact, it is imperative not to delete those "bad" entries without proper inspection. If they belong to built-in Windows services, you might want to repair your copy of Windows instead. Broken Windows entries could be a sign of malware penetration.

    Please see the [Supplementary remarks](#find-broken-servicesps1) section for more info.

- **Find redundant drivers.ps1:** Sometimes, you have two versions of a device driver installed. This script finds them and lists older ones. But please do not use this script with "cleanup" mentality. (To discourage your from that mentality, the script doesn't automatically delete older drivers.) I found this script useful in one instance: On an HP laptop on which a Validity driver was interfering with a Synaptic WBF driver. I've derived this script from a free, open-source script by [Dmitry Nefedov](https://github.com/farag2). Be sure to visit his repo too.

- **Find broken Start menu LNKs.ps1:** Scans both per-user and machine-wide areas of the Start menu to find shortcuts that are potentially broken. For years, I've been adamant to include such a script in my collection because it's not perfect. Today, I gave up. Not everything in this world is perfect; the use case justifies the imperfection. I'll perfect it in time.

    - `WindowsShortcutFactory.1.2.0`: This folder contains a library that `Find broken Start menu LNKs.ps1` uses. The library is free and open-source. Made by Greg Divis, it's available under the MIT license. I've included its full nuget package.

- **Optimize PATH variable.ps1:** If you work with package managers (as a developer) or containerization solutions (as an IT admin), your PATH variable gets dirty soon. This script inspects both copies of PATH (per-user and machine-wide), removes bad or redundant entries, normalizes paths, and displays the optimized results.

- **Repair all volumes.ps1:** Enumerates all fixed-disk volumes and sequentially runs `Repair-Volume` on them to scan them for errors.

### Security

#### Malicious Software Removal Tool

The Malicious Software Removal Tool (shortened as MRT, not MSRT) is an antimalware tool that runs on demand to find and clean a select handful of specific, widespread threats. Windows Update downloads and runs this tool silently each month. Controlled environments in which every change to a system must be documented need to disable the automatic delivery of this tool. The scripts in this folder do exactly that.

- **Prevent Windows Update from installing MRT.reg** disables the monthly delivery of this tool.
- **Allow Windows Update to install MRT.reg** reverts the above.

#### MpDefinitionPackage module

This entire folder, `MpDefinitionPackage`, is a PowerShell module that adds a cmdlet to your PowerShell: `Build-MpDefinitionPackage`. This cmdlet extracts Microsoft malware definition files from one computer and packages them up into a self-extracting archive, so that it can be installed on other computers. It requires WinRAR to work.

I conceived it as a script at a time when our site was suffering a network outage. Not only we couldn't update our antimalware, users were using USB flash drives (notorious for being malware carriers) to transfer files. Desperate times need desperate measures. I wrote this solution to keep our devices secure. Eventually, I turned it into a module.

**Warning:**

- Be aware that Microsoft antimalware definitions are copyright-protected. Handling them, with or without this module, must be in compliance with the copyright laws of your region. Residents of the United States of America must use this module in compliance with the Title 17 of United States Code, section 117 ("Limitations on exclusive rights: Computer programs"), article C (USC17 Â§ 117c).

- I do not guarantee that this solution works. If you wish to update an entire network while preserving Internet bandwidth, the official solutions are _Windows Server Update Services_ and _System Center_.

#### Others

- **Clear-WindowsDefenderHistory.ps1** (deprecated): Clears the "protection history" of Microsoft Defender Antivirus. Starting with Windows 10 version 1703, the antivirus no longer allows users to clear the protection history via its UI. This script worked fine until 2023, when Microsoft added new measures to protect the "history." Now, it is only possible to clear it via Windows Recovery Environment or when your OS is offline.

    The "history" is each user's personal property. It is the owner's discretion to keep or clear it. Valid reasons to clear the history are abundant. For example, [a user on Reddit reported that Defender Antivirus attempted to quarantine a multi-gigabyte file][Defender fail], failed, and ended up wasting disk space with no means to free it. Defender Antivirus is also notorious for its false positives. It has repeatedly attacked innocent apps such as System Informer (digitally signed, competes Microsoft's Process Explorer), WinDjView 2.1, Pencil 3.1.0, Neat Download Manager, and various products from Sordum. Microsoft's false-positive submission form has stopped working. The company constantly misfiles submissions. Attempt to inquire into their fate is met with 502, 404, and 403 HTTP errors.

- **Get-WindowsFirewallStatus.cmd** reports whether Windows Firewall is on or off.

### Shell

#### File associations

The following scripts fix the `.ps1` file association in Microsoft Windows.

- **Fix 'Run with PowerShell' verb (legacy).reg**
- **Fix 'Run with PowerShell' verb (PowerShell 7).reg**
- **Fix 'Run with PowerShell' verb (Windows 10).reg**
- **Fix 'Run with PowerShell' verb (Visual Studio Code - System-wide).reg**

Since at least PowerShell 3.0, there has been a bug in the "Run with PowerShell" verb (formerly "Run with Windows PowerShell") of the `.ps1` files: If your PowerShell script has a mono quotation mark (`'`) in its name, the "Run with PowerShell" command fails. Let's inspect the command string to find out why:

```bash
"C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" "-Command" "if((Get-ExecutionPolicy ) -ne 'AllSigned') { Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass }; & '%1'"
```

The offending part is the last seven letters: `& '%1'"`

In this string, `%1` gets replaced with the name of your `.ps1` file. If this file's name contains mono quotation marks, the parser gets misled.

In legacy PowerShell versions, the solution is to use the `-File` switch instead of the `-Command`. In modern versions of PowerShell (7.x and 5.1 for Windows 10), however, I opted a more fancy approach:

```bash
"C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe" -Command "$host.UI.RawUI.WindowTitle = 'PowerShell 7 (x64)'; if ((Get-ExecutionPolicy ) -ne 'AllSigned') { Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass }; & """%1"""; Pause"
```

I've replaced the offending mono quotation marks with three double quotation marks. This way, I can keep using the `-Command` switch. I've added a new "Pause" instruction that prevents the script window from disappearing.

#### Folder view state

- **Delete folder view state.reg** makes File Explorer forget the view settings you've set on each folder. You can do this from File Explorer's "Folder Options" dialog box. This script saves time during remote support sessions in which interacting with File Explorer is difficult.

#### Icon cache

There was a period of time (2011â€“2016) when Windows was plagued with bugs that corrupted the icon cache. The followings scripts were conceived in that time, as ways of mitigating the problem.

- **Refresh icon cache with IE4UINIT (Windows 7).cmd**
- **Refresh icon cache with IE4UINIT (Windows 10).cmd**
- **Refresh icon cache with MoveFile.cmd**

I have long stopped using them, though. `Refresh icon cache with MoveFile.cmd` is the most effective of those but it is hard-coded to use an installed copy of `MoveFile.exe` from the Microsoft Sysinternals utility set.

#### Promotional Store apps (pre-Setup)

Windows 10 is notorious for downloading and installing promotional Microsoft Store apps without the user's consent. The most notorious of these apps is Candy Crush.

The following Registry scripts enable or disable the aforementioned behavior. Apply them to a Windows installation image for optimal results. If applied to an installed copy, only new users benefit from them. [These scripts are courtesy of Shawn Brink of TenForums.com][TF1].

- **Disable promotional Store apps.reg**
- **Enable promotional Store apps.reg**

#### Special folders under This PC

"Special folders" is a term that Microsoft uses to describe folders that Windows API recognizes. Many of these folders appear on a stock Windows installation. "Program Files" is an example of these folders. It is the default app installation root on Windows. Its default NTFS permissions prevent malicious software without administrative privileges from corrupting other installed apps.

Starting with Windows 8, a hardcoded shortcut for each of the following special folders appears under This PC:

- 3D Objects
- Desktop
- Documents
- Downloads
- Music
- Pictures
- Videos

These shortcuts, however, are far from useful. "Documents," "Pictures," "Music," and "Videos," have long fallen into disuse, with apps from irresponsible developers dumping their files into these folders without the user's consent. "3D Objects" never gained popularity.

The following Registry scripts (.REG) that help you remove or restore said hardcoded shortcuts. [They are courtesy of Shawn Brink of TenForums.com][TF3].

- **Remove all special folders from This PC, 64-bit.reg**
- **Restore all special folders to This PC, 64-bit.reg**
- **Remove all special folders from This PC, 32-bit.reg** (deprecated)
- **Restore all special folders to This PC, 32-bit.reg** (deprecated)

#### Volume icons

In Windows 10, File Explorer's navigation pane shows removable drives twice, once under This PC, and once at the root level, below This PC.

The following Registry scripts disable or re-enable said behavior. [These scripts are courtesy of Shawn Brink of TenForums.com][TF2].

- **Hide volume icons outside This PC.reg**
- **Show volume icons outside This PC, 64-bit.reg**
- **Show volume icons outside This PC, 32-bit.reg** (deprecated)

#### Wallpaper

The following two scripts are co-developed with Ramesh Srinivasan (the author of [WinHelpOnline.com](https://www.winhelponline.com)). More specifically, he wrote them in VBScript first, and I re-wrote them in PowerShell to support Unicode. Then, he credited me in his blog post and we added additional bits to support Windows 10. Back then, I knew zero about PowerShell and its philosophy, so, these scripts are unlike any other PowerShell scripts. In fact, they generate graphical message boxes.

- **Find current wallpaper (Windows 7).ps1**
- **Find current wallpaper.ps1**

#### Windows Search

One of the controversial features of Windows Search in Windows 8 and later is how it handles your search queries. By default, not only it will search your machine, but also transmits your search query to Bing. So, when you search for "Intimate pictures of my husband and I" or "my company's top secret plan for shipping XYZ-123" you don't want Microsoft's Bing to receive these query. In fact, you might not want Microsoft's inept search engine to receive any query at all, regardless of whatever privacy policy they may have in place. For most people, local search and web search are in two different security boundaries.

Use the following Registry scripts to disable the web search module of Windows Search or bring it back.

- **Disable web results in Windows Search.reg**
- **Restore web results to Windows Search.reg**

### Shutdown

The names of these scripts are self-explanatory.

- **Log off.vbs**
- **Power off.vbs**
- **Power off (Alternative).vbs**
- **Restart.vbs**
- **Restart (Alternative).vbs**

### System settings

- **`Disable diagnostics data collection (reversible via Settings app).reg`:** Disables Windows Telemetry programmatically.

    Upon the release of Windows 10, the [telemetry] aspect of the OS instantly became controversial. People would openly accuse Microsoft of espionage. The situation escalated to the point that the European Commission launched an investigation that spanned from 2015 to 2017. Microsoft cooperated with the investigation by releasing [a tool that allows people to inspect telemetry data][telemetry1] gathered from their PCs and [interpret them][telemetry2]. The investigation cleared Microsoft of all charges. (Kaspersky and Tik Tok weren't so lucky. Their EC investigations found them guilty.) While the controversy died (well... mostly), people's aversion to telemetry didn't. The formula to make people hate something, regardless of its merit, is to make it mandatory. There is no UI-based way of disabling telemetry for the end users. So, people continue to hate telemetry.

- **`Disable dump stack logging.reg`:** Disables creation of `DumpStack.log` and `DumpStack.log.tmp` at the root of the C: volume.

- **Set firmware time as UTC.reg:** Configures Windows to interpret the real-time clock as UTC time. Ordinarily, Windows interprets it as the local time corresponding to the time zone you've selected. Most Linux distros interpret it as UTC, so you may need this script if you multi-boot a Linux distro along Windows. After applying the setting, restart the computer.

### Unicode test suite

In this folder, you find a set of text files with file names in Arabic, German, English, Persian, French, Hebrew, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, and Chinese (Simplified). You could use this set to assess the Unicode readiness of any app that opens user-created files.

The names of these files are the titles of the various localized versions of Wikipedia. They're tokens of a time when I had faith in Wikipedia (and Microsoft). These files aren't copyright-encumbered. "Wikipedia" is a trademark of "Wikimedia Foundation," but so don't use this word in the title of your product or organization.

### Update management

- **Clear Windows Update history.ps1:** This scripts clears the so-called Windows "update history," which is a log of installation events, not a history. This log could be potentially misleading. It might report that you've installed the "security update for Visual C++ 2005 SP1 Redistributable Package" on such-and-such date and time, without telling that you've removed it on a later date. However, this fact alone is never a good justification for clearing the Windows Update log. You must only clear a log that has been corrupted and hindering the update process. Quite frankly, I haven't seen a corruption cases since 2019. Perhaps I must deprecate this script.
- **Disable Microsoft Update.ps1** and **Enable Microsoft Update.ps1** are used to enable or disable the "Microsoft Update" channel on the local computer. These scripts are much faster than the cumbersome official GUI way, which I've long forgotten. When the "Microsoft Update" channel is not enabled, Windows uses the "Windows Update" channel instead.
- **Find update on Microsoft Catalog.ps1:** Finds an update package on Microsoft Catalog and returns its ID.
- **Get automatic update services.ps1:** Gives you a list of all update channels registered with the local instance of the Windows Update service. You are probably aware of the "Windows Update" and "Microsoft Update" channels. (The former contains updates for Windows only, the latter for all Microsoft products.) But not everyone knows about WSUS. This script is specifically useful to find out if the local computer is properly registered with WSUS.
- **Install updates with Dism.exe.ps1:** Scans the current folder for Windows updates that you've downloaded from Microsoft Catalog or WSUS, then invokes `Dism.exe` to install them all.
- **Install updates with MsiExec.exe.ps1:** Scans the current folder and all its subfolders for `.msp` files and invokes Windows Installer to install them all.
- **Install updates with PowerShell.ps1:** Scans the current folder for Windows updates that you've downloaded from Microsoft Catalog or WSUS, then invokes `Add-WindowsPackage` to install them all. There was a time when Microsoft released 1.5 GB worth of updates each month. I used to download them once and use this script to install them on several computers at home, thus saving 4.5 GB of download. (At work we use WSUS to save bandwidth.) Before you ask, no, the Delivery Optimization service does not reduce bandwidth consumption for you; it reduces bandwidth consumption for Microsoft's servers. It depends on a centralized peer coordination server on the Internet.
- **Install updates with Wusa.exe.ps1:** Scans the current folder and all its subfolders for `.msu` files and invokes Windows Update Standalone Installer to install them all.

## Supplementary remarks

### Find broken services.ps1

This script often runs into problem querying the `McpManagementService`. The script throws the following error message:

> Get-Service: Service 'McpManagementService (McpManagementService)' cannot be queried due to the following error: PermissionDenied

The Computer Management snap-in and the `sc.exe` also report a similar problem:

```powershell
sc.exe qDescription McpManagementService 
```
```output
[SC] QueryServiceConfig2 FAILED 15100:

The resource loader failed to find MUI file.
```
My friend, Ramesh Srinivasan, has written an [article on this problem][SR-FBS1]. But in short, you must manually change the friendly name and service description of this service in Windows Registry to "Universal Print Management Service".
